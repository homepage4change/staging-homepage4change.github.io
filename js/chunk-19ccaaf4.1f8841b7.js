Through examining the relationship with the object, my work explores the curiosity, guilt and uncertainty when connecting value with identity. Value is often placed in objects, and objects are considerably traced to identity, identity often being intertwined within a cultural narrative. We often make quick assumptions of other people based off the things they choose to surround themselves with. We use objects as indicators for not only how we see ourselves, but also how we choose to understand others. With this painting, there is a depiction of a common object that has clearly been affected by the human experience, a single pair of fake eyelashes that have been worn and crumpled. What does this tell us about the person who holds possession of it? With this still life work, there is an asking of consideration for understanding, but beyond the surface level. The still life asks the viewer to reconsider, to reframe how we perceive something we have assumed ourselves to understand.”",bio:"HAU PHAM is an emerging artist based in Vaughan, Ontario.
